<h1>GHOSTBUSTERS SWIFT GAME</h1>
<p><em>This document provides general information on my Ghostbusters iOS game. 

Why Ghostbusters
-------------
Do you like Ghostbusters? Do you like shooting ghosts? Well this game is for you!

How it Works
------------
You have joined the Ghostbusters! There has been suspicious activity reported in the haunted graveyard. Shoot all the ghosts that appear on the right side of the screen. If a ghost reaches the left side of the screen without being shot, you die! So aim carefully!
